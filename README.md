#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
       Software engineering is the application of structured principles and techniques systematically to aid the design,development,
       testing and the maintenance of software systems with a focus on reliability,quality and efficiency.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
     1. MILESTONE 1-Birth of software engineering (1968-Margaret Hamilton),its in this milestone that software engineering was recognised
        as a distinct engineering discipline marking a shift from ad-hoc to sytematic approaches.
     2. MILESTONE 2-Waterfall model and structured programming(1970).Linear phase by phase waterfal model (Winstone Royce) and structured 
        programming top-down model (Edsger Dijkstra) approaches to software development were introduced during this milestone emphasizing on modular 
        design as a way of bringing order and discipline to software development as well as improving quality and maintenance.
     3. MILESTONE 3-Agile Revolution(1990s-2000s), this milestone challenged the the previous traditional,plan driven approaches with more a
        flexible,iterative and team collaboration approach.This milestone saw a significance shift towards more adaptive,human centred approaches to
        software engineering

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
      1. Planning- this phase involves the defining the scope of the project, the goals,the timeline for expected time frame and the resources.
      2. Requirements Gathering- This is the phase where the user needs and expections are collected and documented.
      3. Design- This phase involves the creation of software architecture detailing the overall design structure (Components,interactions,dataflows) 
         user interfaces,system interface(interaction with other systems services and hardware),performance design(performance requirements interms of
         speed,scalability and reliability).
      4. Implementation- This involves coding(writing software code into chosen programming language),development environment setup(tools,libraries and frameworks)
         unit testing(testing of individual code modules),debugging(fixing errors and bugs from testing) and lastly documenting any changes to the code.
      5. Testing- this involves the overall verification of the software functionality.quality and performance.
      6. Deployment- This involves the release of the software into the the production environment.
      7. maintenance- This is the last phase of the cycle that involves the updating,fixing and refining of the software over time.
      
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer:The differences between waterfall and agile methodologies is that Agile allows for changes and iteration while Waterfall is more regid.
Agile also and allows for a more continuous feedback from customers while Waterfall allows customer involvement mostly in the beginning only,
lastly Waterfall mitigates risk by upfront planning while Agile mitigates risk through iterative development and continous testing.
      Waterfall methodology : is a linear/sequential approach with emphasis on predictabililty,stability and control.The phases involved are;
      requirements,design,design,implementation,testing,deployment and maintenance.
      Scenariors:Legacy system updates (updating the legacy system with documented requirements and limited changes).
                :Predicatable projects (Building of a website with well documented requirements and no expected changes).
                :Regulated industries (developing software for  finance, healthcare where requirements demand an auditable process).
      Agile methodology : is an interacative and incremental approach that emphasizes on collaboration, flexibility and rapid change.
      The phases involved are sptint planning,development,review,retrospective and repeat,
      Scenariors:Research and development(exploring new technologies that require iteration and experimentation.)
                :Innovative projects (such as the development of new mobile app with rapid changes or uncertain requirements).
                :Dynamic environments (such as the building of a platform for a rapidly changing market to suit adaptability).
